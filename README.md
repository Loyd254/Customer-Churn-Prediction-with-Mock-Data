# Customer-Churn-Prediction-with-Mock-Data
This project is a machine learning pipeline designed to predict customer churn based on mock data. It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using Python. The solution leverages a Random Forest classifier to classify customers as churned or retained.
